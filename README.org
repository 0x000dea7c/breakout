* breakout

A simple breakout game to start building the engine for future games.

!!! Not happy with how it turned out; new projects will definitely improve !!!

First project in C++ and related to games and graphics, so there's bunch of silly mistakes.

* Note

Using a lot of dependencies which in part is good because you can focus on the task at hand, however, not so good when
you're trying to learn.

The plan is to get rid of all dependencies and code everything from scratch.

Current dependencies:

- glfw
- glad
- stb_image
- glm
- sdl2, sdl_mixer

* One More Note

Updating and improving this game is not part of the plan; don't expect them.

* Build

You need cmake. The compilation command is at the `compile.sh` file.
